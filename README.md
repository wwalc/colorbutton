-----------------------------------------

A module that register a plugin which provides Text Color and Background Color buttons: http://ckeditor.com/addon/colorbutton

### Installation

**Important:** This module depends on the [Panel Button](https://github.com/wwalc/panelbutton) module, install Panel Button first.

1. Download the [Color Button](https://github.com/wwalc/colorbutton) module, put it into the modules folder, then enable it.
2. Edit selected text format where CKEditor is enabled.
3. Adjust toolbar configuration - add Text/Background Color buttons to the toolbar.
4. Save the text format settings.

**Note:** Both buttons are using inline CSS styles to style the content, so they will work only in text formats where **HTML Filter** ("Limit allowed HTML tags") **is not enabled**
